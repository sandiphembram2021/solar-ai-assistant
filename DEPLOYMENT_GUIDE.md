## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `solar-rooftop-analysis-tool`
   - Description: `AI-powered rooftop analysis for solar installation potential assessment`
   - Set to Public (required for free Hugging Face Spaces)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/sandip/solar_ai
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solar-rooftop-analysis-tool.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

1. **Create a Hugging Face account:**
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/join
   - Sign up or log in

2. **Create a new Space:**
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/spaces
   - Click "Create new Space"
   - Fill in the details:
     - **Space name**: `solar-rooftop-analysis-tool`
     - **License**: `MIT`
     - **SDK**: `Streamlit`
     - **Visibility**: `Public`

3. **Connect your GitHub repository:**
   - In the Space creation form, choose "Import from GitHub"
   - Enter your repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solar-rooftop-analysis-tool`
   - Or upload files manually if preferred

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - In your Space settings, go to "Variables and secrets"
   - Add environment variable:
     - **Name**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: `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`

5. **Deploy:**
   - The Space will automatically build and deploy
   - Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
